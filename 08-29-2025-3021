//see I was confused because they say flower "game" as if there is anything to choose, but there isn't so i was treating this much more open ended than it actually is.
//if the two amount of flowers is even then alice doesen't win so thats out. So i guess we're just counting how many times we can -2 from either side keeping them above one.
