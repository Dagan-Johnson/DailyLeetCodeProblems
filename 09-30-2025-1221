Not too sure why this one is a meduium as you just do exactly what you would think. Not too much real world use for this one i fear as it isn't too safe for the data.

int triangularSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(), x = nums.size();
        while (x > 1) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
                nums[j] = ((nums[j] + nums[j + 1]) % 10);
            }
            x--;
        }
        return nums[0];
    }
};
