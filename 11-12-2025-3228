Query is asking us to move the maximum number of moves where you can move ones to the right if there is an 0 to the right of it. Practiacally the answer is to move the left most one to the right immediatly and then begin moving that group to the right one at a time
untill all the ones are smushed on the far right side. Unfortunatly I did get timed out near the end for this question. I think it could be sped up by instead of making a single move everytime, realizing that the number of moves that needs to be made is equal to the 
size of the consequtive 1's.
class Solution {
public:
    int maxOperations(string s) {
        int ans = 0;
        bool poss = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i++) { //checking that there is a possible move
            if (s[i] == '1' && s[i + 1] == '0') {
                poss = true;
            }
        }
        if (poss == false) // if there's no possible moves just return 0
            return 0;
        bool moves = false;
        while (1) { // no idea how many moves so just gonne break given a condition
            for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
                if(s[i] == '1' && s[i+1] == '0'){ // there is a move to make
                    moves =true; // set the flag to pos to indicate a move was made
                    int j = i+1;
                    while(s[j+1] == '0')j++; // count till a 1 is found, this gives us where to put the current 1 we're selected 
                    s[i] ='0';
                    s[j] ='1';
                    ans++;
                }
            }
            if(moves == false)break; // if moves have not been made in a full rotation that means no moves to be made
            moves = false;
        }
     return ans;
    }

};
